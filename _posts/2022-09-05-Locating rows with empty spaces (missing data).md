Removing rows with empty values (nan)
This code appears to be written in Python and it is performing the following operations on a Pandas DataFrame called df:

It is identifying rows in the DataFrame that contain empty (NaN) values using the isna() function.

It is selecting rows that contain any NaN values using the any() function and the axis=1 argument, which specifies that the function should look at each row.

It is storing the resulting DataFrame, which contains only rows with NaN values, in a new variable called df_nan.

Overall, this code is used to locate rows in the df DataFrame that contain missing or empty values.


`df_nan=df[df.isna().any(axis=1)]`
