This site is intended to support finance and other professionals in applying data-driven techniques while facing and adapting to the fast coming wave of the "big data" revolution.

I am a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) and I was first introduced to Python and its libraries for data analytics (Pandas, Numpy, matplotlib, etc) during the early days of my audit career.  I was amazed at how quickly I was able to accomplish certain tasks in just a fraction of the time it would normally take if I was to perform those same tasks using the more conventionally accepted tools and applications, like Excel spreadsheets for example. I am now a financial reporter and work along side with the accounting investments unit of an organization.  I use Python on a daily basis for pretty much every data manipulation task. 

If you are someone who has heard of Python or would like to have more exposure to it, then this site is intended for you.  I will be posting examples of python code which I encounter during my regular workdays. Please feel free to leave comments and suggestions or any questions you may have at the bottom of each post. And don't hesitate to buy me a coffee!
