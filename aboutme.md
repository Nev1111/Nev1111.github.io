Hi there! I'm a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) and I've been using Python and its data analytics libraries (like Pandas, Numpy, and matplotlib) for several years now, both in my previous role as an auditor and in my current position as a financial reporter. I was blown away by how much faster and more efficient these tools made my work, compared to using traditional software like Excel. These days, I rely on Python for just about every data manipulation task I do.

If you're interested in learning more about Python or want to see how it can be applied in a financial setting, this site is for you. I'll be sharing examples of the Python code I use in my day-to-day work, and I welcome your comments, suggestions, and questions at the bottom of each post. And if you'd like to support my work, feel free to buy me a coffee! Thanks for visiting.
