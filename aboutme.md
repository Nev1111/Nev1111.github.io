Our team, consisting of Certified Public Accountants (CPAs), and we found Python and its data analytics libraries (such as Pandas, Numpy, matplotlib, etc.) during the early days of our audit careers. We were amazed at how much more quickly we could accomplish certain tasks using Python compared to conventional tools like Excel spreadsheets. Currently, as financial reporters working alongside the accounting investments unit of an organization, we use Python daily for nearly every data manipulation task.

If you're interested in Python or want to learn more about it, then our site is perfect for you. We'll be sharing examples of Python code that we encounter in our daily work and welcome your comments, suggestions, and questions in the comment section of each post. And if you're feeling generous, don't hesitate to buy us a coffee!
